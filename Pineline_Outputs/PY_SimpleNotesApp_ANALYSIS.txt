Component Name: FlaskApp.login
Component Description: Login route handling user authentication, session management, and redirecting to the notes page if credentials are valid.
Vulnerabilities:
 - Vulnerabilities found!
 - Number of vulnerabilities: 1
 - Vulnerability Details:
   - Type: Broken Authentication
   - CVE Score: 7.5
   - Exploitation Methods:
     - 1. Supply valid username and a long password (e.g., 'a' * 10000).
2. Server overloads resources or crashes due to excessive computation or I/O operations.
     - 1. Inject SQL injection payloads into the password field.
2. Bypass authentication by exploiting a weak password policy or using a dictionary attack.
     - 1. Use a timing attack to determine valid credentials by measuring authentication response times.
   - Developer Fixes:
     - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.
     - Use secure password storage and validation practices (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
     - Validate and sanitize all user inputs before processing them.

   - Type: Directory Traversal
   - CVE Score: 7.6
   - Exploitation Methods:
     - 1. Supply filename '../../app.py'.
2. Server reads critical code files.
3. Disclosure of sensitive system information.
     - 1. Traverse to application source code files.
2. Steal intellectual property or discover vulnerabilities.
   - Developer Fixes:
     - Validate and sanitize user-supplied filenames before serving files.
     - Restrict file access strictly within allowed directories.

   - Type: Information Exposure
   - CVE Score: 6.5
   - Exploitation Methods:
     - 1. Serve .env files with API keys and credentials.
     - 2. Serve configuration backups revealing sensitive internal data.
   - Developer Fixes:
